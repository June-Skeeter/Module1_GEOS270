# Foundations of Epidemiology

We are going to replicate one of the foundational studies in [Epidemiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology) and the closely related field of [Health Geography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_geography) using modern GIS techniques.  

## Applying Modern Methods to the 1854 Cholera Outbreak

[Dr. John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow#Cholera) was a physician practicing in London where cholera outbreaks were a frequent occurrence due to poor sanitation practices.  Dr. Snow was a skeptic of the miasma theory and a proponent of germ theory.  In 1849 he proposed cholera that it was spread by fecal contaminated water, after comparing cholera rates between London districts supplied by different water companies.
* Five years later, during an outbreak in London's SoHo neighborhood in 1854, Dr. Snow was able to identify the point source of an the outbreak using a hand-sketched map.  He recorded each case of cholera in the area using a dash, and recorded each water pump with a circled dot, creating what today would be called a ‘dot map.’ By recording clusters of disease, and conducting interviews, Snow was able to trace most cases of the outbreak to a single water pump, located on Broad st.
  * Using this map, Dr. Snow was able to convince the local council to remove the pump handle and the outbreak subsided.
  * Despite this, the medical community in London continued to reject the idea that Cholera was caused by fecal contamination for another twenty years.
