## The First Surveys

Started with the construction of large structures (e.g. Egyptian and Mayan Rope stretchers).  As agricultural societies coalesced and grew methods for the systematic collection of information were developed.  Agricultural surveys were conducted and land ownership was recorded.



## The Compass

Invented multiple times
Olmec society
Han dynasty
"south-governor" (sīnán 司南)
First used for navigation in China ~ 1000 B.P.
Made its way to Europe around 800 B.P.

## Line of Sight Methods

Measurements of angles allows surveying of larger areas and over greater distances
Bearings
Distances
Elevations
Sizes

### Gormatici

The Roman empire employed professional surveyors
Massive road network
Agricultural land registry
“Urban” planning
