# What is GIS?

The **GI** stands for **Geographic Information**.  The **S** can be either **Science** or **System**.  You will often see them used interchangeably because they are very closely related.  Basically, you do GI*Science* with a GI*System*.

## What is GIScience?

The science and study of geospatial information: GIScience is a framework we use to understand spatial information.  GIScience is rooted in Cartography, the art and science of graphically mapping.  But GIS is inherently multidisciplinary and drawing on Computer Science, Mathematics & Statistics, Remote Sensing, and many other fields.

## What is a GISystem?

An system or tool we use to store and analyze geospatial information can broadly be considered a GISystem.  Until a the late 20th century, atlases and library map catalogues were our most advanced GIS.  Now we have a wide range of computer and web based GISystems.  The smartphone app that can give directions across campus are small GISystesms with limited applications.  The "desktop" GIS applications like ArcGIS Pro that you will be using have wide functionality and are mainly limited by computational capacity.  Google earth engine uses cloud computing to store and process massive amounts of planetary scale imagery.

# What can be done with GIS?

A GIS can be used to help solve a wide range of geographic problems in different fields: Epidemiology/Public Health, Planning (Urban, Hazards), Conservation & Resource Management, Ecology/Biology, Economics, and Climate Science.

## What will we do with GIS?

Lecture will explain theories and concepts of GIScience and provide background on GISystem.  In labs you will learn how to do GIScience using GISystems.  Labs will focus on applied examples and practical solutions.  This module will give you a tertiary overview of the development of GIS, starting with the pre-historic evolution of cartography and on into present day applications.
