# What is GIS?
{: .no_toc }

The **GI** stands for **Geographic Information**.  The **S** can be either **Science** or **System**.  You will often see them used interchangeably because they are very closely related.  Basically, you do GI*Science* with a GI*System*.

# What is GIScience?

The science and study of geospatial information: GIScience is a framework we use to understand spatial information.  GIScience is rooted in Cartography, the art and science of graphically mapping.  But GIS is inherently multidisciplinary and drawing on Computer Science, Mathematics & Statistics, Remote Sensing, and many other fields.

# What is a GISystem?

An system or tool we use to store and analyze geospatial information can broadly be considered a GISystem.  Until a the late 20th century, atlases and library map catalogues were our most advanced GIS.  Now we have a wide range of computer and web based GISystems.  The smartphone app that can give directions across campus are small GISystesms with limited applications.  The "desktop" GIS applications like ArcGIS Pro that you will be using have wide functionality and are mainly limited by computational capacity.  Google earth engine uses cloud computing to store and process massive amounts of planetary scale imagery.

# What can be done with GIS?

A GIS can be used to help solve a wide range of geographic problems in different fields: Epidemiology/Public Health, Planning (Urban, Hazards), Conservation & Resource Management, Ecology/Biology, Economics, and Climate Science.

## What will we do with GIS?

Lecture will explain theories and concepts of GIScience and provide background on GISystem.  In labs you will learn how to do GIScience using GISystems.  Labs will focus on applied examples and practical solutions.  


# History of GIS

A holistic understanding of GIS can help you use it effectively *and* responsibly.  A good way to start off is to look at the history of the subject.  Where did it come from?  What has it been used for?  How has it impacted people?

## Decolonizing GIS

During the course introduction I said that GIS has historically been used as a tool of oppression in settler societies.  What did I mean by that?  I mean that history is filled with examples of GISystems being used by those in power to influence, direct, or dictate polices and practices that harm marginalized communities.  In some cases, the negative impacts are untended consequences.  In many others, the negative impact is the intended result.  Maps, and the arbitrary, poorly though out lines we draw on them, have enormous power to determine the outcome of someones life.  Which side of a border you grow up on can dictate:

* Which school you attend
* What rights you have
* Your tax rate
* Where you can travel
* What political system you live under


### Redlining Video

[Redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining) is the systematic denial of services to racially marginalized groups by government and lending institutions in order to forcibly segregated communities.  Redlining has been more thoroughly documented and researched in the US.  The video below gives a thorough overview of the practice and how its negative impacts.  It is very important to note that [Redlining occurred in Canada as well](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43100660).  Much of what is talk about in the video applies the same on this side of the border.

### [**Written Submission C1**](Assessment.md#written-submission-c1)

Redlining was done using paper maps and manual surveys.  The GISystems today are so much more powerful and capable.
