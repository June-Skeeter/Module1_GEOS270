## Evolution of Cartography

The earliest maps presented diverse and abstract representations of reality.  They used very different medium than we do today today, and are sometimes quite difficult to see as maps today.

## Systematic Data Collection
As agricultural societies coalesced and grew methods for the systematic collection of information were developed and the first surveys were conducted.  Methods were needed to conduct agricultural surveys, construct buildings, and create plan settlements.  Objects needed to be drawn to scale for accurate representations.

## The Compass

Invented multiple times
Olmec society
Han dynasty
"south-governor" (sīnán 司南)
First used for navigation in China ~ 1000 B.P.
Made its way to Europe around 800 B.P.

## Line of Sight Methods

Measurements of angles allows surveying of larger areas and over greater distances
Bearings
Distances
Elevations
Sizes

### Gormatici

The Roman empire employed professional surveyors
Massive road network
Agricultural land registry
“Urban” planning
