# History of GIS

A holistic understanding of GIS can help you use it effectively *and* responsibly.  A good way to start off is to look at the history of the subject.  Where did it come from?  What has it been used for?  How has it impacted people?


## Decolonizing GIS

During the course introduction I said that GIS has historically been used as a tool of oppression in settler societies.  What did I mean by that?  I mean that history is filled with examples of GISystems being used by those in power to influence, direct, or dictate polices and practices that harm marginalized communities.  In some cases, the negative impacts are untended consequences.  In many others, the negative impact is the intended result.  

### Redlining: A Prominent Historical Example

[Redlining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining) is the systematic denial of services to racially marginalized groups by government and lending institutions in order to forcibly segregated communities.  For much of the 20th century, redlining was legal and wide spread across North American cities.  The practice has been more thoroughly documented and researched in the US.

* The video below gives a thorough overview of the practice and how its negative impacts.  It is very important to note that [Redlining occurred in Canada as well](https://www.jstor.org/stable/43100660).  Much of what is talk about in the video applies the same on this side of the border.

# Evolution of Cartography

The earliest maps presented diverse and abstract representations of reality.  They used very different medium than we do today today, and are sometimes quite difficult to see as maps today.

# Systematic Data Collection

As agricultural societies coalesced and grew methods for the systematic collection of information were developed and the first surveys were conducted.  Methods were needed to conduct agricultural surveys, construct buildings, and create plan settlements.  Objects needed to be drawn to scale for accurate representations.
