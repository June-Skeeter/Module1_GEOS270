# Indigenous Place Names: Countering Colonialism

The lands that comprise Canada have been inhabited for thousands of years and have histories that stretch back well before the colonial era.  Many colonial mapping efforts were centered on erasing Indigenous Peoples and their Histories.  One way they accomplished this was through the use of place names.  A prominent example of this is Ch'ich'iyuy.
* Ch'ich'iyuy is a Skwxwú7mesh word that translates to "The Two Sisters" or "Twin Sisters".  The peak is steeped in tradition and [history](https://www.legendsofvancouver.net/two-sisters-vancouver-bc).  The colonial name "The Lions" completely disregards this history.  The name is based of Heraldry, a system of family crests and symbols from Europe.
