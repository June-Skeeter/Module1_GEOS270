# Defining a Coordinate Reference Systems

A Coordinate Reference System (CRS) is *a coordinate-based system used to locate geographical entities*.  A CRS can be applied locally, regionally, or globally.  A Cartesian grid (think graph paper) is a simple 2D coordinate reference system for referencing locations on the surface of a flat plane.  A spherical coordinate system (think latitude/longitude) is a more complex 2D coordinate system for referencing locations on the surface of a sphere.
