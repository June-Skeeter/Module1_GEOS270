# Choosing a Projection

Here is a simple summary to help you think though which class of map projection you might want to use.  Categories in **bold** are the most common classes we use.

| Projection Category | Properties | Common Uses |
| :------------- | :-------------: | -------------: |
| **Conformal** | Preserves local shapes and angles | Topographic maps, navigation charts, weather maps |
| **Equal Area** | Preserves areas | Dot density maps, thematic maps |
| Equidistant| Preserves distance from one or two specified points to all other points on the map | Maps of airline distances, seismic maps showing distances from an earthquake epicenter |
| True Direction | All directions are true from a single specified point (usually the center) to all other points on the map | Navigation and route planning maps |
| **Compromise** | No point is completely distortion free; distortion is minimized near the center and along the equator | World maps |
