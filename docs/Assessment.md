You can use the submit your answers to the Assessment via the Module 1 Quiz on Canvas.  Questions are listed here with hyperlinks to the relevant section of the module if you need help finding answers.


## Written Answers 

Written answers should be brief but they should adequately answer the question.  Bullet point format is sufficient unless otherwise specified.  All written answers will be evaluated following this general rubric.

* Scores & categories are general guides, you TA may assign scores between these levels
* Your TA will provide brief comments where applicable, if you need more feedback you can follow up with your TA.

|Score|      Category      |                             Details                              |

|40%  |Insufficient        |Minimal effort, missing major key points, or serious logical flaws|
|60%  |Below Expectations  |Missing a few key points or minor logical flaws                   |
|80%  |Met Expectations    |Hits key points and mostly well constructed                       |
|100% |Exceeds Expectations|Clearly thought out, concise, and astute                          |


## File Uploads

Maps and file uploads will be evaluated for completeness following the rubric below.  Later in term, maps will be evaluated for correctness and cartography.  For now, as long as you can make a map with the necessary elements, you'll get full credit!

|Score| Category |                     Details                     |
