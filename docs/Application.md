# Getting Started with ArcGIS Pro:

### Learning Objectives:

* Get your bearings with ArcGSI Pro
* Introduction to spatial analysis
* Brief overview of Digitizing and Georeferencing
* Create and share a map

## Accessing ArcGIS Pro

See the [Lab Access page](https://june-skeeter.github.io/GEOS270W1/docs/Labs.html)

## Getting Started
The first step is opening ArcPro.  You can find it using the Windows start tab or search bar.  When ArcPro opens choose the Map under Blank Templates as shown below.  Then create your new project.  I've named mine Lab1_Project so I can easily identify it.  This will be the name of the folder your project resides in.  Set the location to an appropriate workspace.  I am working on my own computer, and my workspace workspace is "C:\GEOG270\2021_S1\Labs".  This is the location where the project folder will be reside.  If you are unfamiliar with the Windows operating system (OS), it might be helpful to take a few moments to learn about the differences between Windows and the OS (Mac, Linux) you are used to working with.  Once you set up a new project, close ArcGIS Pro for now.
