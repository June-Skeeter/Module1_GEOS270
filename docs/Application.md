# Getting Started with ArcGIS Pro

In this lab, you will work through a couple tutorials that will help you get your bearings using the ArcGIS Pro software package.  Then you will work though a tutorial on map projections.  Finally, you'll recreate an example from history using modern geospatial analysis methods.



## Accessing ArcGIS Pro

See the [Lab Access page](https://june-skeeter.github.io/GEOS270_Syllabus_2022_S1/docs/Labs.html) of the Syllabus.  To opne ArcPro from a lab computer or once you have it installed on your own system, you can find it using the Windows start tab or search bar.
