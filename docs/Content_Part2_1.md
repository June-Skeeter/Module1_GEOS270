# Flattening the Blue Marble

This is what earth looks like when you take a picture of it from 29,000 kilometers away.  This is the original [Blue Marble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Marble) photo, taken from Apollo 17.

# Steps of Abstraction

The Earth is a lumpy ball of rock in space.  It is far too complicated to represent fully.  We need to create abstractions to simplify the shape of the earth so we can map it in 2D.

## Approximating the Geoid

Approximating the **Geoid** is the first step in the abstraction process.  A
- Smoothed topography, less lumpy ball of rock

### 3)**Datum**:
- Completely smoothed oblate spheroid

### 4)**Geographic Coordinate System (GCS)**:
- Spherical coordinate system corresponding to points on the datum

### 5)**Projected Coordinate System (PCS)**:
- Projection of a 3D GCS onto a 2D plane (computer screen, paper map, etc.) -->
